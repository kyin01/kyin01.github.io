Wordle Solving Algorithm
</summary>
<br>
After studying machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, k-means clustering, and Naive Bayes throughout the semester, I worked on a project to create algorithms to solve the word-game Wordle with two other teammates. I coded Wordle, then my teammates and I each created separate algorithms based on different strategies to solve Wordle. After measuring the efficiency of each of our algorithms, we also utilized q-learning to see if we could create a more efficient algorithm by combining our three separate methods.

SNAP Food Assistance Modeling
</summary>
<br>
As a member of NYU's Business Analytics Club Insight Team, I spent a semester learning different types of regression models such as linear regressions and random forests as well as data management and analytics with python and SQL. As a part of a 4 person team, we looked into a dataset regarding SNAP, a food assistance program across the US. As a team, we cleaned the data using SQL and applied different models with Python to try and predict funding based on key demographics.
