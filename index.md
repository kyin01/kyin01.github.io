SNAP Food Assistance Modeling
</summary>

As a member of NYU's Business Analytics Club Insight Team, I spent a semester learning different types of regression models such as linear regressions and random forests as well as data management and analytics with python and SQL. As a part of a 4 person team, we looked into a dataset regarding SNAP, a food assistance program across the US. As a team, we cleaned the data using SQL and applied different models with python to try and predict funding based on key demographics.
